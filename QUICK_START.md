# Quick Start Guide - Mental Health Risk Assessment

## What You Have

This project includes a complete **Mental Health Risk Assessment System** with:

- 50,000+ patient dataset with realistic mental health data
- AI-powered risk prediction using multiple algorithms
- Interactive web interface for healthcare professionals
- Command-line demonstration with sample scenarios
- Comprehensive documentation and clinical recommendations
- Professional PDF report generation with graphs and visualizations

## Quick Start Options

### Option 1: Command Line Demo (Recommended to start)
```bash
python demo_model.py
```
This runs an interactive demonstration showing:
- Multiple patient scenarios (Low, Moderate, High, Critical risk)
- Risk factor analysis
- Clinical recommendations
- Interactive patient assessment

### Option 2: Web Application
```bash
streamlit run simple_app.py
```
Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`

Features:
- Professional web interface
- Real-time risk assessment
- Interactive sliders for patient data
- Visual risk factor analysis
- PDF reports with graphs and visualizations
- CSV and text report exports

### Option 3: Generate New Dataset
```bash
python data_generator.py
```
Creates a new dataset with 50,000 patient records.

## What the System Does

### Risk Assessment
- Analyzes 20+ risk factors including clinical scores, behavioral indicators, and treatment history
- Calculates risk probability using weighted algorithms
- Categorizes risk levels: Low, Moderate, High, Critical
- Provides clinical recommendations based on risk level

### Clinical Integration
- Standardized assessment scales: PHQ-9, GAD-7, CSSRS, Beck Hopelessness
- Treatment history tracking: Previous attempts, hospitalizations, compliance
- Environmental factors: Social support, housing stability, healthcare access
- Family history analysis: Depression, anxiety, suicide, substance abuse

### Output Features
- Risk probability scores (0-100%)
- Risk level categorization
- Individual risk factor contributions
- Clinical intervention recommendations
- Exportable assessment reports (CSV, Text, and PDF with graphs)

## Clinical Use Cases

### For Mental Health Companies:
1. **Initial Patient Screening** - Quick risk assessment for new patients
2. **Regular Monitoring** - Track risk changes over time
3. **Crisis Prevention** - Identify high-risk patients for intervention
4. **Resource Allocation** - Prioritize care based on risk levels
5. **Treatment Planning** - Guide clinical decisions with data

### Risk Levels & Actions:

#### Low Risk (< 20%)
- Regular therapy sessions
- Medication management
- Lifestyle recommendations
- Support group referral

#### Moderate Risk (20-40%)
- Weekly therapy sessions
- Safety planning
- Medication review
- Family involvement

#### High Risk (40-60%)
- Immediate psychiatric evaluation
- 24/7 monitoring or hospitalization
- Crisis intervention team activation
- Remove access to lethal means

#### Critical Risk (> 60%)
- IMMEDIATE EMERGENCY INTERVENTION
- Call 911 or emergency services
- Psychiatric hospitalization
- Crisis team activation

## Important Notes

### Clinical Disclaimer:
- This is a demonstration system for educational purposes
- Should not replace clinical judgment or professional assessment
- All predictions should be reviewed by qualified mental health professionals
- Use as a supplementary tool for risk assessment

### Data Privacy:
- All data is synthetic and anonymized
- No real patient information is used
- System designed for HIPAA compliance in production use

## Learning Outcomes
